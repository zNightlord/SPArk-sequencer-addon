# SPArk Sequencer Addon

This add-on is a fork of https://github.com/The-SPA-Studios/sequencer-addon. It contains a set of tools that improve the sequence workflow in Blender.
It can be used for Storyboarding or Layout, to work simultaneously on different shots,
leveraging Blender's native concepts of _scenes_ and _cameras_, as well as the _Video Sequence Editor_ (VSE).

Features:
- Synchronised VSE and scene timelines.
- VSE based shot management system (add, rename, delete, etc.).
- Batch rendering shots from the VSE.
- Editorial import/export capabilities (based on OTIO).
- Shared folders (collection linking between scenes).

The add-on is under development to adapt it to work with vanilla blender. It's not ready for production at this time.
