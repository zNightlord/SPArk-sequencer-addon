# SPArk Sequencer Addon

This add-on is a fork of https://github.com/The-SPA-Studios/sequencer-addon. It contains a set of tools that improve the sequence workflow in Blender. 
This branch additionally modified, fixing for Bforartist sequencer branch.
It can be used for Storyboarding or Layout, to work simultaneously on different shots,
leveraging Blender's native concepts of _scenes_ and _cameras_, as well as the _Video Sequence Editor_ (VSE).

Features:
- Synchronised VSE and scene timelines.
- VSE based shot management system (add, rename, delete, etc.).
- Batch rendering shots from the VSE.
- Editorial import/export capabilities (based on OTIO).
- Shared folders (collection linking between scenes).

Bforartists changes:
- Update for 4.0 blf and gpu (remove bgl)
- Add OTIO pip install under preferences
- Change the UI Layout (a little bit)
- Fix some operators those have issues
